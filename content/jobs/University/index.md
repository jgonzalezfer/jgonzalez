Responsible for working on the design, development and maintenance of telemetry systems and vehicle communication, allowing to measure and transmit important information about the efficiency of the vehicle, battery charge, energy consumption, speed and other variables. Also, send the information to the database, to consume the data on a website, thus analyzing the status of the car.

- Collaborate with a small team of computer engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering students and faculty to spearhead a solar car build from scratch for the Atacama Solar Race.
- Work closely with the electrical engineers and management team to develop, document and manage the electronic components with Arduino and their communication with the board using C++.
